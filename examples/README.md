# AutoGen Examples

This folder contains reference implementations and learning examples.

## Files:

### `assistant.py`
- **Purpose**: Minimal working AutoGen agent example
- **Use case**: Environment testing, basic agent template
- **Learning**: Shows simplest possible agent setup with API key loading

### `playright-mcp.py` 
- **Purpose**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration example
- **Use case**: Demonstrates how to connect AutoGen agents to external MCP servers
- **Learning**: Blueprint for integrating specialized tools (web browsing, CAD software, etc.)

## How to use these:

1. **Test your setup**: Run `assistant.py` to verify your environment works
2. **Learn MCP integration**: Study `playright-mcp.py` to understand tool integration patterns
3. **Build real applications**: Use patterns from these examples in your production code

## Main application:

The actual intelligent agent system is in `../real_routing.py` - these are just reference examples.
